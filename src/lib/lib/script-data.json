These mimic examples shown on p. 404 of “Behind Bars\"\nby Elaine Gould. For the best results with staccato dots, use an articulation with “Avoid Staff Lines” unchecked.\n\nBy default, the script searches for articulations using the '.' character (ASCII code 46) for non-SMuFL fonts and\nthe SMuFL dot character (UTF code 0xe4a2) for SMuFL fonts. This character must be the Main Character in Finale's\narticulation definition dialog. You can override this to search for a different character code using a\nconfiguration file. (See below.)\n\nTo use the script, you enter the notes you want to display, and it removes the noteheads in between the first\nand last notehead, adjusts any staccato dots, and adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes,\nunless there is one already there. If you want a slur as well, add it manually before or after running the script.\n\nThe steps to use this script are:\n\n1. Add the notes you want to display, with or without accidentals. Normally you choose notes with noteheads\nthat follow a straight-line path as closely as possible. They can be reduced size or grace notes.\n2. Add staccato dots if you want them.\n3. Add a slur if you want it.\n4. Run the script on the pattern you just entered.\n\nThe script takes the following actions:\n\n1. Searches for a selected pattern, skipping rests at the beginning and stopping at the first rest it encounters.\n2. Hides the noteheads on all but the first and (optionally) last entry.\n3. Hides accidentals on any noteheads that were hidden.\n4. Aligns the staccato dots in a straight line path. (The path may not be exactly straight\nif the articulation is set to avoid staff lines.)\n5. Adds a gliss mark (tab slide) between the first and last notes, if one does not already exist.\nIf you have entered parallel chords, it adds a gliss mark for each note in the chord.\n\nBy default, the script does not hide the last selected note (or any accidentals it may have). You can override\nthis behavior with a configuration file or if you are using RGP Lua 0.59 or higher, you can cause the script\nto hide the last note by holding down Shift, Option (Mac), or Alt (Win) when you invoke it.\n\nTo use a configuration file:\n\n1. If it does not exist, create a subfolder called `script_settings` in the folder where this script resides.\n2. Create a text file in the `script_settings` folder called `note_automatic_jete.config.txt`.\n3. Add either or both of the following lines to it.\n\n```\ndot_character = 46           -- This may be any character code you wish to search use, including a SMuFL character code.\nhide_last_note = true        -- This value will be reversed if you hold down a modifier key when invoking the script.

(Approximately 1/4 space on either end.\nIt may be longer depending on the length of the character defined for the articulation.)\n\nIf you are working with a keyboard or other multi-staff instrument, the script automatically extends the top\narticulation across any staff or staves below, provided the lower staves also have the same articulation mark.\nIt then hides the lower mark(s).

This makes for a better import, especially into MuseScore 4.\n- When a parallel `.musx` or `.mus` file is found, changes all rests in the MusicXML to floating if they were floating rests\nin the original Finale file.

Limitations include\n\n- Key modes must have 7 diatonic steps per octave\n- Linear key signatures must use the standard accidental order and size (for their EDO value)\n- Linear tonal centers must follow the standard circle of fifths for their respective key signatures\n\nThe dialog has the following main components:\n\n- **List of Keymodes [Delete] [Delete All]**: Shows any currently existing custom key modes in the document, with buttons to delete the current or all of them.\n- **MIDI Note for Middle C**: The MIDI note that plays back for the note written one ledger line below the treble clef.\n- **Base Tonal Center**: For linear modes, the note that is the tonal center when there is no key signature. For nonlinear modes, the note that is the tonal center.\n- **Linear/Nonlinear**: Linear modes can be transposed into the full array of key signatures. Nonlinear modes only ever have the specified key signature.\n- **Accidental Font**: The font that is used for accidentals.\n- **Accidental Symbols**: Opens a dialog that allows you to specify strings for up to 7 flat steps and 7 sharp steps plus a natural symbol. These strings can have more than one symbol. If no accidentals have been set up, the dialog is populated with the default characters specified in the document settings.\n\n---\n\n- **Diatonic Step Map**: Specifies the number of divisions of the octave between each white note on the keyboard. Before any custom key modes are created in the document, this is initialized with the common practice 12-EDO values. Note that the diatonic step map _always_ starts with C, irrespective of which note is the base tonal center.\n- **EDO Presets Pulldown**: This pulldown provides a shortcut for populating the diatonic step map for commonly used EDO values.\n\n---\n\n- **[Linear Key Modes] Accidental Step Amount (Chromatic Halfstep Size)**: This the step amount for each accidental in the key signature as you step into more sharps or more flats in the key signature. To get common practice key signatures, set it to the number of divisions of the octave in a chromatic half-step. (The **EDO Presets Pulldown** sets this value automatically for linear key modes.)\n- **[Nonlinear Key Modes] Accidental Order [note][amount]**: The seven pairs of edit fields allow you to specify the accidentals in the nonlinear key signature in any arbitrary order with any mix of sharps of flats. The first amount value of 0 or blank terminates the key signature.\n- **Accidental Octaves**: Opens a grid of values by clef types. Each value specifies the octave in which the accidental in that slot appears for that clef. Linear key modes using common practice key signatures generally do not need to specify anything here. Nonlinear key modes almost certainly _will_ need to specify these values.\n- **Revert**: Reverts the accidental octaves to their default values.","noStore":false,"date":"2025-06-08","categories":["Key","Signatures"],"maxFinaleVersion":"","author":{"website":"","name":"Robert Patterson","email":""},"fileName":"key_modes_manage.lua"},{"scriptGroupName":"","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","notes":"","maxJWLuaVersion":"","minFinaleVersion":"","author":{"website":"","name":"Jari Williamsson","email":""},"name":"Note Duration Statistics","undoText":"Note Duration Statistics","id":"","maxFinaleVersion":"","version":"1.0.1","requireScore":false,"categories":["Note"],"menuItems":["Note Duration Statistics"],"noStore":false,"revisionNotes":["Edited by Nick Mazuk to give more detailed duration statistics"],"minJWLuaVersion":"","shortDescription":"Counts the number of each note value in a given region","requireSelection":false,"date":"2020-06-26","scriptGroupDescription":"","fileName":"note_duration_statistics.lua"},{"requireSelection":true,"undoText":"Note Filter","name":"Note Filter...","notes":"","maxJWLuaVersion":"","version":"1.0","requireScore":false,"categories":[],"shortDescription":"Deletes notes above or below a specified note","id":"","scriptGroupDescription":"","author":{"name":"Jacob Winkler","email":"","website":""},"minFinaleVersion":"","menuItems":["Note Filter..."],"scriptGroupName":"","revisionNotes":[],"copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","noStore":false,"date":"2024-01-27","maxFinaleVersion":"","minJWLuaVersion":"","fileName":"pitch_filter.lua"},{"scriptGroupDescription":"Change the shape of noteheads in the current selection","requireScore":false,"scriptGroupName":"Noteheads Change","name":"Noteheads Change","maxJWLuaVersion":"","menuItems":["Noteheads Change Repeat","Noteheads Change..."],"minJWLuaVersion":"0.70","minFinaleVersion":"","date":"2024-06-09","noStore":false,"undoText":"Noteheads Change","version":"0.39","notes":"Change __notehead shapes__ on one or all layers of the current \nselection to one of these options: \n\n> Circled | Default | Diamond | Guitar Diamond  \n> Hidden | Number | Round | Slash | Square  \n> Strikethrough | Triangle | Wedge | X  \n\nThis script produces an ordered list of notehead types, \neach line beginning with a configurable _hotkey_. \nCall the script, type the _hotkey_ and hit [Return].  \n\nIn __SMuFL__ fonts like _Finale Maestro_, shapes can vary according \nto duration values.

Presets for various raster sizes can be selected from the popup menu. A brief description of each raster size pops up when it is selected, paraphrased from the MOLA guidelines on parts and scores, Elaine Gould's \"Behind Bars\", and Steven Powell's \"Music Engraving Today: The Art and Practice of Digital Notesetting.\"\n\nSystem margins can use different units than page units. The default unit for system related measurements are spaces, but the plug-in will remember what was last used.\n\nYou can set or scale the staff spacing as you reformat, without the need to 'Respace Staves' using the Staff Tool. This can be useful for doing things like reformatting a tabloid sized score to A3 where slight adjustments to staff spacing might need to be made. Note that if you scale the staff spacing by a percentage, the dialog will be reset to 100% so that you don't keep applying the same transformation over and over. Systems can be locked or unlocked through the plug-in as needed before reformatting.\n\nIn addition to formatting the score and parts, you can set up \"special parts\" to have alternate formatting. This makes it easy to do something like create something like a Piano/Vocal score that may have different requirements than both the full score and the regular instrumental parts. The \"special parts\" feature could also be used to reformat a subset of parts without touching the others simply by diabling the 'Score' and 'Default Parts' sections of the plug-in.","maxJWLuaVersion":"","minJWLuaVersion":"0.70","undoText":"Page Format Wizard","version":"1.2.2","scriptGroupName":"","fileName":"page_format_wizard.lua"},{"author":{"website":"https://carlvine.com/lua/","email":"","name":"Carl Vine"},"undoText":"Pitch Changer","shortDescription":"Change all notes of one pitch in the region to another pitch","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","version":"0.39","requireSelection":false,"scriptGroupName":"Pitch Changer","requireScore":false,"notes":"This script revives Jari Williamsson's _JW Change Pitches_ \n2017 plug-in to work on Macs with non-Intel processors.\n\nIdentify __from__ and __to__ pitches by note name (__a-g__ or __A-G__) \nfollowed by accidental (__bbb/bb/b__ ... __#/##/###__) as required. \nMatching pitches will be changed in every octave. \nFor transposing instruments on transposing scores select \n__Written Pitch__ to affect the pitch you see on screen. \nTo repeat the last change without a confirmation dialog use \nthe _Pitch Changer Repeat_ menu or hold down [_Shift_] when opening the script. \n\nSelect __Modeless Dialog__ if you want the dialog window to persist \non-screen for repeated use until you click _Cancel_ [_Escape_]. \nCancelling __Modeless__ will apply the _next_ time you use the script.\n\n> __Key Commands:__ \n\n> - __A__-__G__: Note Names (automatically capitalised)\n> - __0__-__4__: Layer number (delete key not needed)\n> - __z__: Toggle \"Direction\" Mode\n> - __w__: Swap the __From:__ and __To:__ values \n> - __s__: Shortcut for __#__ \n> - __m__: Toggle the __Modeless__ setting \n> - __r__: Toggle the __Written Pitch__ setting \n> - __q__: Display these script notes","categories":[],"minJWLuaVersion":"0.70","id":"","scriptGroupDescription":"Change all notes of one pitch in the region to another pitch","menuItems":["Pitch Changer Repeat","Pitch Changer..."],"revisionNotes":[],"noStore":false,"name":"Pitch Changer","date":"2024-07-05","maxFinaleVersion":"","minFinaleVersion":"","maxJWLuaVersion":"","fileName":"pitch_changer.lua"},{"shortDescription":"Change one specific pitch to another","noStore":false,"minJWLuaVersion":"0.67","name":"Pitch Singles Changer...","version":"0.19","categories":["Entries","Pitch","Transposition"],"undoText":"Pitch Singles Changer","id":"","notes":"Change one specific pitch to another. \nPitch specification is exact and immutable: \n\n> • First character: note name __A__-__G__  \n> &nbsp;  (Lower case will be replaced by upper case)  \n> • Last character: octave number __0__-__9__  \n> • In between: accidentals if any (__bbb/bb/b__ ... __#/##/###__)  \n> &nbsp;  (you can use __s__ instead of __#__) \n\n__C4__ is middle C. __B4__ is a major seventh above that. \nMistakes in the pitch name format must be corrected \nbefore pitches will be changed. \nFor transposing instruments on transposing scores select \n__Written Pitch__ to change the note that you see on screen.","date":"2024-07-01","requireSelection":false,"scriptGroupDescription":"","scriptGroupName":"","menuItems":["Pitch Singles Changer..."],"maxFinaleVersion":"","author":{"email":"","website":"https://carlvine.com/lua/","name":"Carl Vine"},"maxJWLuaVersion":"","revisionNotes":[],"minFinaleVersion":"","requireScore":false,"copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","fileName":"pitch_singles_changer.lua"},{"menuItems":["Pitch: Chord Notes Keep-Delete..."],"date":"2024-04-17","scriptGroupName":"","id":"","name":"Pitch: Chord Notes Keep-Delete...","minJWLuaVersion":"0.70","requireScore":false,"author":{"name":"Jacob Winkler, Nick Mazuk & Carl Vine","website":"","email":"jacob.winkler@mac.com"},"maxFinaleVersion":"","categories":["Pitch","Transposition"],"version":"1.36","minFinaleVersion":"","copyright":"CC0 https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","scriptGroupDescription":"","maxJWLuaVersion":"","revisionNotes":[],"notes":"Select a note within each chord to either keep or delete, \nnumbered from either the top or bottom of each chord. \n\n- __1__ deletes (or keeps) the top (or bottom) note \n- __2__ deletes (or keeps) the 2nd note from the top (or bottom) \n- etc. ...\n\n> If __Note Number__ or __Layer__ are highlighted  \n> then these __Key Commands__ are available:\n\n> - __z__: toggle keep/delete \n> - __x__: toggle top/bottom \n> - __c__: toggle \"Modeless\"\n> - __q__: show these notes \n> - __1__-__9__: note number \n> - __0__-__4__: layer number \n> - (delete key not needed for number entry) \n\nSelect __Modeless__ if you prefer the dialog window to \n\"float\" above your score and you can change the score selection \nwhile it's active.
